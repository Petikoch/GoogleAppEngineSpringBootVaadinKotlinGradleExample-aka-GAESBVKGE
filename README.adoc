Live Demo: https://gaesbvkge.appspot.com/

== Introduction

This example shows the setup of a Gradle project using this fascinating pieces of software

* Google App Engine Flex Java 8 Runtime
** https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/dev-java-only
** with the V.2 Gradle Plugin
*** https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/app-gradle-plugin
* Spring Boot 2.1.x
** https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot
* Vaadin 13.0.x
** https://vaadin.com/flow
* Gradle 5.4.x
** with the new, type-safe "Gradle Kotlin Script" Syntax (instead the "old", dynamic Groovy syntax)
** https://gradle.org/
* Kotlin 1.3.x
** https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/


If you want to deploy the example yourself to the Google App Engine you need

* a GCP account
* the Google "Cloud  SDK" on your local machine installed (including gcloud etc)
* then you can run `gradlew appengineDeploy`
* See https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/quickstart for details

== My steps to produce the example

. Create a minimal Spring Boot Vaadin Kotlin Example
.. https://start.spring.io/
.. Pick all you need/want and download the result
.. Unpack it, open it in your favourite IDE (e.g. IntelliJ) and run it using `gradlew bootRun`
.. Approx. 5 Minutes

. Add a minimal Vaadin Page
.. I used `MainView` from https://spring.io/guides/gs/crud-with-vaadin/
.. Result: link:src/main/kotlin/ch/petikoch/examples/gaesbvkge/ui/vaadin/MainView.kt[src/main/kotlin/ch/petikoch/examples/gaesbvkge/ui/vaadin/MainView.kt]
.. Approx. 5 Minutes

. Now deploy it to Google App Engine Flex
.. This was the hard stuff for me... it took hours to find the right bits from the sea of outdated information (I wasn't a GAE user before).
.. Vaadin needs "sticky sessions", which wasn't available in Flex, up to to recent introduction of the WebSockets Beta
... `network: session_affinity: true`, see link:src/main/appengine/app.yaml[src/main/appengine/app.yaml]
... https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/introducing-websockets-support-for-app-engine-flexible-environment
... https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/using-websockets-and-session-affinity (scroll down to the end)
.. The default `resources.memory_gb` in link:src/main/appengine/app.yaml[src/main/appengine/app.yaml] (==when not set) is 0.6 and was too small for this "Spring Boot Vaadin Combo". The GAE instances didn't start up properly and the deployment failed.
... I set it to 2 gb, see link:src/main/appengine/app.yaml[src/main/appengine/app.yaml]
.. Using the "new" 2.x Version of the App Engine Gradle Plugin
... https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/app-gradle-plugin
... and not the old 1.x Version which is everywhere in the official documentation
... Result: link:build.gradle.kts[build.gradle.kts]
.. Properly configure the Gradle App Engine Plugin
... There were no "Gradle Kotlin Script" Syntax examples, all the examples used the Groovy Syntax
... Result: link:build.gradle.kts[build.gradle.kts]

== Final last words

I hope this example helps the reader to save some hours.
If you have questions / remarks, please use issue tracker of this Github project.

Thanks to all the creators of the fascinating pieces of software used in the examples like

* Google App Engine
* Spring Boot
* Vaadin
* Kotlin
* Gradle

And to all the creators of the underlying technology like Java, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, ...
