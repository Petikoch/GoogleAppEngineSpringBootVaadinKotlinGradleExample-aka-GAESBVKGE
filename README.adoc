= GAESBVKGE: The Google AppEngine Spring Boot Vaadin Kotlin Gradle Example

Live Demo: https://gaesbvkge.appspot.com/

== Introduction

This example shows the setup of a Gradle project using a lot of absolutely great software

* Google AppEngine Flex Java 8 Runtime
** https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/dev-java-only
** with the V.2 Gradle Plugin
*** https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/app-gradle-plugin
* Spring Boot 2.1.x
** https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot
* Vaadin 13.0.x
** https://vaadin.com/flow
* Gradle 5.4.x
** with the new, type-safe "Gradle Kotlin Script" Syntax (instead the "old", dynamic Groovy syntax)
** https://gradle.org/
* Kotlin 1.3.x
** https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/

If you want to deploy the example yourself to the Google AppEngine you need

* a GCP account
* the Google "Cloud  SDK" on your local machine installed (including gcloud etc)
* `gradlew appengineDeploy`
* See https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/quickstart for details

== My steps to produce the example

. Create a minimal Spring Boot Vaadin Kotlin Example
.. https://start.spring.io/
.. Pick all you need/want and download the result
.. Unpack it, open it in your favourite IDE (mine is IntelliJ) and run it using `gradlew bootRun`
.. Approx. 5 Minutes

. Add a minimal Vaadin Page
.. I used `MainView` from https://spring.io/guides/gs/crud-with-vaadin/
.. Approx. 5 Minutes

. Now deploy it to Google AppEngine Flex
.. This was the hard stuff for me... it took hours to find the right bits from the sea of outdated information (I wasn't a GAE user before).
.. Vaadin needs "sticky sessions", which wasn't available in Flex, up to to recent introduction of the WebSockets Beta
... `network: session_affinity: true`, see `app.yaml`
... https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/introducing-websockets-support-for-app-engine-flexible-environment
... https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/using-websockets-and-session-affinity (scroll down to the end)
.. The default `resources.memory_gb` in `app.yaml` is 0.6 and was to small for this "Spring Boot Vaadin Combo". The GAE instances didn't start up properly and the deployment failed.
... I set it to 2 gb, see  `app.yaml`
.. Using the "new" 2.x Version of the AppEngine Gradle Plugin
... https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/app-gradle-plugin
... and not the old 1.x Version which is everywhere in the official documentation
.. Properly configure the Gradle AppEngine Plugin
... There were no "Gradle Kotlin Script" Syntax examples, all the examples used the Groovy Syntax


== Final last word

I hope this example helps you saving some hours.
If you have questions / remarks, please use Issue tracker of this Github project.

I thank to all the creators of the fascinating pieces of software like

* Google AppEngine
* Spring Boot
* Vaadin
* Kotlin
* Gradle

And to all the creators of the underlying technology like Java, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, ...

Best regards,
