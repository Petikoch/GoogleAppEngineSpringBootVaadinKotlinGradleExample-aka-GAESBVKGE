== Introduction

This example shows the setup of a Gradle project using these fascinating pieces of software

* Google App Engine Flex Java 8 Runtime
** Role: Cloud runtime environment (PAAS)
** https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/dev-java-only
** with the V.2 Gradle Plugin
*** https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/app-gradle-plugin
* Spring Boot 2.1.x
** Role: Application framework for the JVM (Java, Groovy, Kotlin, ...)
** https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot
** https://start.spring.io/
* Vaadin 13.0.x
** Role: Webapplication UI Toolkit
** https://vaadin.com/tutorials/vaadin-quick-start
* Kotlin 1.3.x running on Java 8
** Role: Modern, well designed programming language
** https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/
* Gradle 5.4.x
** Role: Build tool
** with the new, type-safe "Gradle Kotlin DSL" Syntax (instead the "old", dynamic Groovy syntax)
** https://gradle.org/

== If you want to run this example yourself on your local machine

. Install an up-to-date version of a Java 8 JDK from e.g. https://adoptopenjdk.net/
. Use an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse to make like easy
. Clone this repo to your local machine and open it in your favorite IDE
. Run `gradlew bootRun` to run the webapp on your local machine http://localhost:8080

== If you want to run this example in Google App Engine

. Install the tooling for "Google Cloud" on your local machine according https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/quickstart
. Update to the lastest version of the `gcloud` tooling using `gcloud components update`
. Run `gradlew appengineDeploy` in your IDE or in a shell

== Steps to produce this example (May 2019)

. Create a minimal Spring Boot Vaadin Kotlin Example (approx. 5 Minutes)
.. https://start.spring.io/
.. Pick all the stuff you need/want (Gradle/Maven, Java/Kotlin/Groovy, Vaadin, Security, Reactive Web, ...) and download the result
.. Unpack it, open it in your favourite IDE (e.g. IntelliJ) and run it using `gradlew bootRun`

. Add a minimal Vaadin Page (approx. 5 Minutes)
.. I used `MainView` from https://spring.io/guides/gs/crud-with-vaadin/
.. Result: link:src/main/kotlin/ch/petikoch/examples/gaesbvkge/ui/vaadin/MainView.kt[src/main/kotlin/ch/petikoch/examples/gaesbvkge/ui/vaadin/MainView.kt]

. Adjust the Grade project with the necessary lines and files like `app.yaml` for deployments to the Google App Engine (Flex) (approx. 5 minutes if you follow my example)
.. This was the hard stuff for me... it took hours to find the right bits from the sea of outdated and sometimes incomplete information (I wasn't a GAE user before)
.. Since Vaadin is a server-side focused technology, it needs "sticky sessions", which wasn't available in Google App Engine (Flex), up to to recent introduction (February 2019) of the WebSockets Beta
... Add `network/session_affinity: true` to link:src/main/appengine/app.yaml[src/main/appengine/app.yaml]
... Note: The `session_affinity` option is at the moment not mentioned in the `app.yaml` reference docs https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/reference/app-yaml. I don't know how "experimental" it is but it seems to work fine and makes totally sense.
... For the records, the WebSockets Beta announcement:
.... https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/introducing-websockets-support-for-app-engine-flexible-environment
.... https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/using-websockets-and-session-affinity (scroll down to the end)
.. The default `resources.memory_gb` in link:src/main/appengine/app.yaml[src/main/appengine/app.yaml] is 0.6 and was too small for this "Spring Boot Vaadin Combo". The GAE instances did not start up properly and were not considered "healthy", the deployment always failed.
... I increased it, see link:src/main/appengine/app.yaml[src/main/appengine/app.yaml]
.. Using the "new" 2.x Version of the App Engine Gradle Plugin
... https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/app-gradle-plugin
... and not the old, deprecated 1.x Version (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gradle-appengine-plugin) which is everywhere in the official documentation (like here https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/using-gradle)
... Result: link:build.gradle.kts[build.gradle.kts]
.. Properly configure the Gradle App Engine Plugin
... There were no "Gradle Kotlin DSL" syntax examples, all the examples used the Groovy Syntax
... Result: link:build.gradle.kts[build.gradle.kts]
... For the records
.... https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/app-gradle-plugin/issues/348

== Caution: Combining Vaadin with Google App Engine (Flex) considered potentially harmful

Classic Vaadin (Framework 8, Flow) is a **server-side focused technology**.

There is a lot of state on the server-side.
E.g. inside the HTTP-Session of a Webcontainer like Tomcat, there is a VaadinSession.
The VaadinSession is the home of the UI Toolkit state on the server-side ("half objects pattern").
The implementation of the "half objects pattern" syncs e.g. the value of a textfield from the client-side browser with the corresponding half object on the server-side.

Google App Engine (Flex) is a **highly dynamic environment** where instances of your application may be started or killed at any time.
There is absolutely no warranty in Google App Engine (Flex),
that the server instance running one instance of your Vaadin application and hosting some of the HTTP-Sessions of your users,
exists during the lifetime of the HTTP-Session of your users. Your Google App Engine (Flex) server instance and hence your HTTP-Sessions may be killed at any time.

**This is the container era**!

You have the same issues when you run your Vaadin application on Kubernetes, Openshift, Docker Swarm, ...
This has a potential huge impact on the way you write your application using a **server-side focused technology**.

The traditional solutions to that type of problem are either moving the UI state of your application to the client (e.g. Angular, React with Redux, Vue.js,...)
or insisting on using a **server-side focused technology** but "pimped" with approaches like session replication using e.g. "Spring Session", see e.g. https://vaadin.com/tutorials/microservices/high-availability or
https://vaadin.com/forum/thread/17281467/kubernetes-deployment.

But session replication is not easy and puts a lot of burden on the developers, read https://vaadin.com/blog/session-replication-in-the-world-of-vaadin for more details to the topic.

If you want to stay "on the server-side" I would recommend to investigate instead in a "uni-directional" UI pattern approach (based on the ideas of Flux/Redux/MVI/...)
and only keep the "bare" (UI-Toolkit agnostic) UI-State "somewhere" in a "high-available" fashion.
Why not use a technology like Vaadin just as replaceable "UI-State renderer"?
The "uni-directional" UI pattern approach gives you many more other benefits beside of beeing able to potentially run easily in a **highly dynamic environment**
like Kubernetes or Google App Engine (Flex).

== Final last words

I hope this example helps the reader to save some hours "to set things up".
If you have questions / remarks, please use issue tracker of this Github project.

Thanks to all the creators of the fascinating pieces of software used in the examples like

* Google App Engine
* Spring Boot
* Vaadin
* Kotlin
* Gradle

And to all the creators of the underlying technology like Java, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, HTML, HTTP, TCP, ...
